            <h4>RULES</h4>

            <p>
                All players start at a random location on the grid and have 3 hearts and 0 Action Points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every 24 hours, everyone will receive 1 Action Point (AP). The time the point is given may vary day to day.
            </p>
            <p>
                At any time you like, you can do one of the following actions:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Move to an adjacent, unoccupied square (1 AP)</li>
                <li>Shoot someone who is within your range (1 AP). Shooting someone removes 1 heart from their health.</li>
                <li>Upgrade your range (3 AP)</li>
                <li>Add an action to another player (1AP)</li>
                <li>Add a heart to yourself or to another player(3 AP)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                At the start of the game, everyone has a range of 2. That is, they can shoot or trade with somehow within 2 squares of them. Upgrading your shooting range increases this by 1 square each time.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a player is reduced to 0 hearts, then he's dead. Any action point the dead player had are transferred to the player who killed them. Dead players remain on the board and not removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Players are able to send gifts of hearts or actions points to any player currently within their range.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dead players can have a heart sent to them. This will revive that player who will have 1 heart and 0 AP.
            </p>

            <h4>ADDITIONAL NOTES</h4>

            <!--            <p>-->
            <!--                Dead players form a jury. Each day they vote,-->
            <!--                and whoever received most votes will be 'haunted',-->
            <!--                and not revive any AP for that day.-->
            <!--            </p>-->
            <p>
                Once a day, at a random time, a heart will spawn on the field. The first player to move into the square containing the heart will revive an additional heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game ends when a clear 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place can be determined. Once there are 4 players left, they will see if they can agree on the placing.
            </p>
            <!--            <p>-->
            <!--                Action points are secret! Probably a good idea to try and hide how many you have.-->
            <!--            </p>-->
            <p>
                You can't win this game without making some friends and stabbing some backs. Probably.
